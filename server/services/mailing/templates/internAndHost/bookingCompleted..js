    <p>  
      We can confirm that ${params.internName} will be staying with ${params.hostName} for the duration of their placement!
      </p>
    <p>
      Click ${bookingLink} to view the details of your booking.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will now leave you two to get to know each other! Weâ€™ll be back in touch before the placement but in the meantime, please let us know if you have any questions.
